Firewall Ideas
- shape will be straight up from front of tank, then angle back
	- pass under first cross bar
- reasonably sized rectangular cutout above fuel tank
	- Dzus pins probably fine here
- firewall mounts to tabs with clip nuts
- split primary wall down center
- cut perfect profile of chassis out of sides
- mount wall to engine, replace breather with threaded plate (keep intake mount holes)
- ensure belts don't touch hot part and are blocked from fuel
- come up with clever wall for fuel - maybe run neck back and up
- LTC velcro to wall or cell
- Al tape all seems
- lambda and harness pass through right side of secondary wall, add soft edge
- small titrary wall infront of runners to meet rules
- barrel connector placed low to the right in primary wall
- small adaptor plate for barrel connector, ~2 dzus fasteners, Al tape to seal (this way harness can be easily removed on flanged connector side)
- barrel connector right on access panel
