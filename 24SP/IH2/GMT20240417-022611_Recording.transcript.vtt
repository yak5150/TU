TELEPHONE_USER: Hello! My name is Jacob Wirral, and this is the working interview for Ih 2.

2
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.569
TELEPHONE_USER: Would you like to

3
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.710
TELEPHONE_USER: introduce who you are? And our relationship.

4
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.700
Valerie Werle: Okay, I am Valerie Worrell, and I am Jacob World's mom.

5
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.000
Valerie Werle: Alright.

6
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.440
TELEPHONE_USER: Get started with some questions

7
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.460
TELEPHONE_USER: so

8
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.739
TELEPHONE_USER: could you describe your job?

9
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.900
TELEPHONE_USER: What you do?

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.760
TELEPHONE_USER: How long your typical work day is, and

11
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.660
TELEPHONE_USER: 5

12
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.379
TELEPHONE_USER: you work at home like? Is it hybrid

13
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.770
TELEPHONE_USER: at a site.

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.360
Valerie Werle: Sure

15
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.220
Valerie Werle: my job is

16
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.849
Valerie Werle: I'm officially called a radiologic technologist.

17
00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:59.099
Valerie Werle: I specialize in cat scan.

18
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.469
Valerie Werle: my, I do not work in the home I have to work outside the home. Obviously to do. You need

19
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.890
Valerie Werle: devices that

20
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.809
Valerie Werle: produce radiation. So they're usually in the hospital or a clinic

21
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.385
Valerie Werle: typical work. Day is

22
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.569
Valerie Werle: for me is usually an 8 h shift.

23
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.588
Valerie Werle: which can be a day shift

24
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.269
Valerie Werle: 7 to 3, 8 to 4, 30

25
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.480
Valerie Werle: for a second shift, 3 to 1130,

26
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.460
Valerie Werle: or a night. Shift. 11 PM. To 7 Am.

27
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.839
Valerie Werle: Some of us not necessarily read me, but some of my coworkers work. 12 h shifts.

28
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.269
Valerie Werle: we work Monday through Friday weekends, holidays.

29
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.570
Valerie Werle: The hospital 24, 7.

30
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.850
Valerie Werle: Okay.

31
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.260
TELEPHONE_USER: Oops.

32
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.400
TELEPHONE_USER: Question 2.

33
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.079
TELEPHONE_USER: What training and or education did you receive to perform your job?

34
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.570
TELEPHONE_USER: Do you feel that your training was sufficient?

35
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.300
TELEPHONE_USER: And what surprises came up

36
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.619
TELEPHONE_USER: like through education or training that was never addressed.

37
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.780
Valerie Werle: Okay.

38
00:02:18.478 --> 00:02:20.869
Valerie Werle: when I went to school

39
00:02:21.424 --> 00:02:26.619
Valerie Werle: for this, I there were different ways. We could do it. You could go and just

40
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.223
Valerie Werle: take a

41
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.690
Valerie Werle: course through a hospital

42
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.149
Valerie Werle: and basically get trained on the job.

43
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.640
Valerie Werle: And then you were allowed to sit for your boards.

44
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.769
Valerie Werle: But you have to pass boards to be a registered radiologic technologist.

45
00:02:45.496 --> 00:02:48.760
Valerie Werle: I decided to get an associate's degree.

46
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.706
Valerie Werle: So I went to college.

47
00:02:51.770 --> 00:03:00.260
Valerie Werle: actually, for 3 years, because, so many people were going into this field at the time that I had to wait a year on a waiting list to get in

48
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.900
Valerie Werle: So when I finally got in I got my associates degree.

49
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.310
Valerie Werle: I

50
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.599
Valerie Werle: set for my boards and then began working.

51
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.170
Valerie Werle: some people get a bachelor's degree in this.

52
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.070
Valerie Werle: Usually you only do that if you're gonna move up into management, though.

53
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.190
Valerie Werle: nowadays you have to.

54
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.120
Valerie Werle: you have to go through certain courses. You can't just learn on the job. Like, we used to

55
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.529
Valerie Werle: became certified in cat scan by taking another board.

56
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.839
Valerie Werle: which that was learned on the job also. Nowadays you can't really do that like you did.

57
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.089
Valerie Werle: Now you have to take courses through accredited programs.

58
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.995
Valerie Werle: But

59
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.970
Valerie Werle: I pretty much

60
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.750
Valerie Werle: felt

61
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.069
Valerie Werle: somewhat ready for my job when I was kind of set free from my program where I learned how to do this.

62
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.930
Valerie Werle: But

63
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.380
Valerie Werle: healthcare and taking care of people is

64
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.160
Valerie Werle: you can't really plan for everything that's gonna happen.

65
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.070
Valerie Werle: So every

66
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.566
Valerie Werle: learning something new and

67
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.740
Valerie Werle: you kind of don't know what you don't know until you're in that situation

68
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.030
Valerie Werle: learning it

69
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.330
Valerie Werle: something that it was. So.

70
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.172
Valerie Werle: Yeah, I wasn't really prepared for was

71
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.246
Valerie Werle: probably how to deal with things emotionally that I saw that were

72
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.700
Valerie Werle: terrible.

73
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.569
Valerie Werle: some of the terrible

74
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.670
Valerie Werle: and like with child abuse.

75
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.289
Valerie Werle: we would have to scan, and X-ray

76
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.290
Valerie Werle: children that were abused. That was really hard to know how to deal with that.

77
00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:01.949
Valerie Werle: I remember one time

78
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.218
Valerie Werle: with a 16 year old that

79
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.409
Valerie Werle: was basically brain dead, because he fell out of back the jeep.

80
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.569
Valerie Werle: and I will.

81
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.000
Valerie Werle: mother. And to see him she just was besides herself crying, and

82
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.010
Valerie Werle: they had decided to donate his body, and

83
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.500
Valerie Werle: we would have to take X-rays every 2 h on him.

84
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.360
Valerie Werle: Make sure the lungs were okay

85
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.899
Valerie Werle: and that was difficult, because

86
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.140
Valerie Werle: just looking at him, knowing he was gonna die. And what was gonna happen to him. Things like that are

87
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.650
Valerie Werle: we're hard to deal with.

88
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.390
Valerie Werle: and nobody

89
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.410
Valerie Werle: for that.

90
00:05:37.613 --> 00:05:39.739
Valerie Werle: So that's probably like the hardest stuff.

91
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.777
TELEPHONE_USER: Well, I guess that kind of leads into our next next question.

92
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.210
TELEPHONE_USER: Do you like your job? Why or why not?

93
00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:50.909
Valerie Werle: Nick.

94
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.369
Valerie Werle: Yeah. Oh, go ahead. Sorry.

95
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.621
TELEPHONE_USER: I was just gonna say, if if you didn't do this, what else would you?

96
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.669
TELEPHONE_USER: what do you think it would do.

97
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.530
Valerie Werle: Okay? So I do like my job. Every day is different. Every hour is different.

98
00:06:08.255 --> 00:06:10.040
Valerie Werle: It's not mundane

99
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.669
Valerie Werle: at all, because you're dealing with humans

100
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.945
Valerie Werle: and

101
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.140
Valerie Werle: when you're working alongside an emergency room, you never know what you're gonna get.

102
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.239
Valerie Werle: I do like it. Sometimes it can be a lot. We're very, very busy

103
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.450
Valerie Werle: and trying to stay up on

104
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.320
Valerie Werle: all the patience and getting the work done can be difficult, and that can be stressful when we're short staffed.

105
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.400
Valerie Werle: I free.

106
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.509
Valerie Werle: You ask me.

107
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.300
TELEPHONE_USER: It's so.

108
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.320
TELEPHONE_USER: So if you didn't do this, what would you

109
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.590
TELEPHONE_USER: doing.

110
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.375
Valerie Werle: So if I didn't do this.

111
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.834
Valerie Werle: that's a tough question.

112
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.340
Valerie Werle: Well.

113
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.510
Valerie Werle: for one.

114
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.529
Valerie Werle: I wanted to be a stay at home, mom.

115
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.880
Valerie Werle: That was what I really wanted for my kind of career, if you wanna call it

116
00:07:11.405 --> 00:07:17.270
Valerie Werle: that's what I wanted to do more than anything. But that's not technically a career job. So

117
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.349
Valerie Werle: that's why I went with the account.

118
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.499
Valerie Werle: if I wasn't doing this

119
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.050
Valerie Werle: and my dream job would probably be teaching cat scan

120
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.860
Valerie Werle: if I could.

121
00:07:30.026 --> 00:07:31.484
Valerie Werle: A long time.

122
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.450
Valerie Werle: but nowadays you have to have a master's degree to do that.

123
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.120
Valerie Werle: Stop

124
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.380
Valerie Werle: made it difficult to, you know. Go back into school to do that

125
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.270
Valerie Werle: book.

126
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.820
TELEPHONE_USER: But what's up?

127
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.190
TELEPHONE_USER: Let's move on to the next question.

128
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:58.620
TELEPHONE_USER: so oh, you'll like this one. Do you feel that your pay is adequate for the demands of your job.

129
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.140
TELEPHONE_USER: Why why not.

130
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.400
Valerie Werle: Okay.

131
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:02.910
Valerie Werle: So at

132
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:09.830
Valerie Werle: right now, living in Sprint and Pennsylvania, I do not feel my pay is where it should be.

133
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.060
Valerie Werle: And the reason I say that is, when we used to live near

134
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.310
Valerie Werle: Baltimore, Maryland.

135
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.550
Valerie Werle: on

136
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.810
Valerie Werle: I made

137
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.520
Valerie Werle: close to maybe

138
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.310
Valerie Werle: 35, $40 an hour.

139
00:08:26.142 --> 00:08:29.119
Valerie Werle: Depending on what shift I was working on.

140
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.200
Valerie Werle: and I,

141
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.750
Valerie Werle: Baltimore.

142
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.320
Valerie Werle: approximately

143
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.260
Valerie Werle: 15 years ago.

144
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.639
Valerie Werle: and I am just now

145
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.530
Valerie Werle: hitting that pay in Scranton.

146
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.940
Valerie Werle: It's taken me 15 years.

147
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.769
Valerie Werle: What I made when I left Baltimore, because the pay up here is so crappy

148
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.070
Valerie Werle: on.

149
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.390
Valerie Werle: That's why

150
00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:01.790
Valerie Werle: I'm working a lot of us are working to fight that to get our pay where it needs to be.

151
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:03.450
Valerie Werle: So.

152
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.760
TELEPHONE_USER: Do you think that's something that is widespread through the

153
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.229
TELEPHONE_USER: through radiology? Or is that more of something

154
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.940
TELEPHONE_USER: geographic.

155
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:19.400
Valerie Werle: It's geographical when you live near the bigger cities, like Philly, Baltimore, Pittsburgh.

156
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.205
Valerie Werle: New York City.

157
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:27.660
Valerie Werle: the bigger cities you, you make more money, and that's usually because there's more hospitals and clinics.

158
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:37.009
Valerie Werle: So the turnover rate is very high, like, if if you don't like what you make, you don't like your job. You just switch and go somewhere else, and then they'll pay you more.

159
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.189
Valerie Werle: Get you there?

160
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.970
Valerie Werle: Then the other hospital has to update

161
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:48.619
Valerie Werle: to pull people to there, so that kind of keeps the rates up higher. But when you live in like a rural area like we do

162
00:09:51.313 --> 00:09:54.379
Valerie Werle: there's not a turnover, you know, like most.

163
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.100
TELEPHONE_USER: Writer.

164
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.613
Valerie Werle: Work with have worked there 20 plus years.

165
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:12.410
Valerie Werle: a. Or the younger people only stay for a few years and then leave. But the people that stay forever, and there's just no turnover. So they haven't had to up to pay, because

166
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.600
Valerie Werle: nobody's going anywhere.

167
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.700
Valerie Werle: you know.

168
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.210
Valerie Werle: So.

169
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.189
TELEPHONE_USER: Do you also get benefits.

170
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.373
Valerie Werle: I do get benefits.

171
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.940
Valerie Werle: I'm only a part time worker.

172
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.579
Valerie Werle: but I work pretty much full time hours.

173
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.820
Valerie Werle: I

174
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:37.639
Valerie Werle: I could I they do give me benefits where I could buy into the health insurance if I wanted to, at a higher rate, because I'm part time

175
00:10:38.351 --> 00:10:45.750
Valerie Werle: but because your Dad has such good health insurance because he's a teacher. We use his health insurance.

176
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.360
TELEPHONE_USER: But okay.

177
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:50.380
Valerie Werle: Guys singer also offers vision dental.

178
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.900
Valerie Werle: I have a 401 K that I can contribute to that. They they will match

179
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.569
Valerie Werle: 6% up to 6% of what I put in there.

180
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.879
Valerie Werle: So that's good.

181
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.320
Valerie Werle: I get some paid time off. We don't get sick days, which is what's

182
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.090
Valerie Werle: kind of ridiculous.

183
00:11:09.856 --> 00:11:14.970
Valerie Werle: But they give us personal day, personal time off days they call.

184
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:16.980
TELEPHONE_USER: But back.

185
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.199
Valerie Werle: And vacation time. I earn that

186
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.370
Valerie Werle: I get so much time for every hour I work.

187
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.240
TELEPHONE_USER: Okay.

188
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.123
TELEPHONE_USER: alright, a bit of a pivot. Now,

189
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:31.830
TELEPHONE_USER: go to S.

190
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:41.629
TELEPHONE_USER: How does your job affect your relationship with people around you, especially the closest people. Maybe you could choose one person to describe that.

191
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.520
Valerie Werle: And Kay

192
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.129
Valerie Werle: Well, I can pick Jeff right now.

193
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.420
Valerie Werle: I

194
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.860
Valerie Werle: so my job affects your brother.

195
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.910
Valerie Werle: because.

196
00:11:57.515 --> 00:12:02.394
Valerie Werle: for example, right now we're very short staffed. So this week I had

197
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.670
Valerie Werle: I don't even know how many extra hours over time.

198
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.620
Valerie Werle: 16, maybe over time. So I worked like

199
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.449
Valerie Werle: I don't even know I I work a lot, so I haven't hardly seen your brother all week.

200
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.869
Valerie Werle: so he's kind of himself. He's having to make himself dinner.

201
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.369
Valerie Werle: drive himself to all his games. I missed his games.

202
00:12:27.322 --> 00:12:29.099
Valerie Werle: His volleyball games.

203
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.869
Valerie Werle: It affected him also because he had it ingrown. I just

204
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.840
Valerie Werle: I don't know if you want to know this or not for your for this interview. But he had the ingrant toenail

205
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.380
Valerie Werle: that was bad.

206
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:50.649
Valerie Werle: probably like a week and a half ago, and today was the first time I was off in order to take him to the doctor, so that, like affects him and the whole family

207
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.309
Valerie Werle: when I work so much

208
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:53.960
Valerie Werle: so

209
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.986
Valerie Werle: it it can make things difficult, you know. And and

210
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.910
Valerie Werle: My family time is very important to me.

211
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.015
Valerie Werle: So

212
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.989
Valerie Werle: That's why I tried to work part time.

213
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.210
Valerie Werle: so it doesn't affect the family.

214
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:11.620
TELEPHONE_USER: Let's see.

215
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.440
TELEPHONE_USER: would you consider that this job is your career?

216
00:13:21.321 --> 00:13:28.369
TELEPHONE_USER: And secondly, maybe you can. Or maybe you can start by telling me what a career is to you.

217
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:29.610
TELEPHONE_USER: Okay.

218
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:35.029
Valerie Werle: Yeah. So to me, a career is something that you.

219
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:40.790
Valerie Werle: a job that you go into, that you are in for the long haul.

220
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:45.850
Valerie Werle: something that you fall into, that you enjoy.

221
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.870
Valerie Werle: that you're going to advance yourself in

222
00:13:50.837 --> 00:13:53.699
Valerie Werle: you're gonna climb the ladder a little bit.

223
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.440
Valerie Werle: It's something, you know, like you, you

224
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:08.329
Valerie Werle: you do it for a long time, but you'd like it, too, and it's it's what you wanted to do.

225
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:15.189
Valerie Werle: So for me. I feel it is a career like I I started off out of X-ray school.

226
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.629
Valerie Werle: you know, right out of college started doing X-rays.

227
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.500
Valerie Werle: Then I advanced myself by learning Caspian.

228
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.129
Valerie Werle: I sat for my boards for that.

229
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.020
Valerie Werle: I worked a lot while, you guys.

230
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:37.929
Valerie Werle: we're little. And then I stayed a little bit, but then it came back into it. And now that you guys are getting older, I'm working more

231
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.090
Valerie Werle: on.

232
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:40.810
Valerie Werle: And

233
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.790
Valerie Werle: I also noticed, you know, that I've been in this field longer. Now

234
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.560
Valerie Werle: I feel comfortable.

235
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.576
Valerie Werle: training new people and

236
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.929
Valerie Werle: speaking up in my job where I didn't used to do that.

237
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.990
Valerie Werle: No, it used to be, I would just come

238
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.990
Valerie Werle: or could go home, but now I feel more invested in it.

239
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.810
Valerie Werle: So right

240
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.250
Valerie Werle: good.

241
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.660
Valerie Werle: I mean.

242
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.930
TELEPHONE_USER: Well, we can move on to our final question. Which is.

243
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:17.400
TELEPHONE_USER: have you ever felt threatened by losing your job from anything, from layoffs to competition.

244
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.530
TELEPHONE_USER: Done.

245
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.230
TELEPHONE_USER: Yeah?

246
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.069
Valerie Werle: I really haven't felt threatened in my job very often.

247
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:33.166
Valerie Werle: What I do it. We're always needed.

248
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.710
Valerie Werle: It's very rare that

249
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.640
Valerie Werle: we are over staffed.

250
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.309
Valerie Werle: we're always understaffed. So that's never been an issue.

251
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.919
Valerie Werle: W. One thing, when I early on in my career, I used to get really nervous that I would lose my job.

252
00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:57.589
Valerie Werle: but that was because I was not confident in what I was doing, and I was afraid of

253
00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.020
Valerie Werle: being up to the

254
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.420
Valerie Werle: fired

255
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.989
Valerie Werle: Nowadays I know better, you know I'm more confident, and I also have learned, like

256
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.477
Valerie Werle: not what I could get away with. That's not the right word. But

257
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.810
Valerie Werle: you know, if you make

258
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.909
Valerie Werle: work, it's just a mistake, and you move on, you learn from it, and you move on.

259
00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.930
Valerie Werle: whereas before I would just like.

260
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:28.370
Valerie Werle: Oh, my God, I made a mistake. The the radiologist is gonna yell at me. You know. I'm gonna get fired, you know. I

261
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.469
Valerie Werle: I would get really, really, really upset about it.

262
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.880
Valerie Werle: And now I just I don't.

263
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.080
TELEPHONE_USER: Okay.

264
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.640
TELEPHONE_USER: well, that's great.

265
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.800
Valerie Werle: It's.

266
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.560
TELEPHONE_USER: Yeah.

267
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.411
TELEPHONE_USER: all right. Well, that wraps up our interview.

268
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.650
TELEPHONE_USER: thank you very much for answering all those questions definitely learned a lot.

269
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.550
TELEPHONE_USER: And alright. Let's wrap it up.

270
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.260
Valerie Werle: Okay.
